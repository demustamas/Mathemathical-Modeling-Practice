On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient {GPU} implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the {ILSVRC}-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

            In order to ensure the safety of railway transportation, it is necessary to regularly check for faults and defects in the railway system. Visual inspection technology is conducive to improving the low efficiency, poor economy and inaccurate detection results of traditional detection methods. This paper introduces the research and contribution of various scholars in the field of visual inspection, summarizes the application and development of visual inspection technology in the railway industry, and finally forecasts the future research direction of visual inspection technology.},

Mandriota etc. put forward the
corrugation detection method based on filter features and machine
learning models [13]. They extracted Gabor texture feature from
a rail image, and apply the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) method
to identify corrugation. This method verifies that machine vision
is efficient to inspect rail corrugation, but it has two limitations.
First, the method is based on global features of a rail image, so it is
difficult to guarantee the detection performance for local or small
corrugation. Second, this method has low detection speed, because
Gabor filtering is time-consuming for high resolution images.
Recently, Li et al. [23] pointed out that the energy of corrugation
lines was concentrated in the interval of low frequency but the
energy of background lines was often scattered, and proposed a
detection method, named accumulate energy thresholding (AET),
based on frequency features of rail images. This method, however,
needs quite a few parameters, which are nontrivial to obtain
optimized values.},

  abstract   = {Thousands of miles of railroad track must be inspected twice weekly by a human inspector to maintain safety standards. A computer vision system, consisting of field-acquired video and subsequent analysis, could improve the efficiency of the current methods. Such a system is prototyped, and the following challenges are addressed: the detection, segmentation, and defect assessment of track components whose appearance vary across different tracks and the identification and inspection of special track areas such as track turnouts. An algorithm that utilizes the periodic manner in which track components repeat in an inspection video is developed. Spectral estimation and signal-processing methods are used to provide robust detection of the periodically occurring track components. Results are demonstrated on field-acquired images and video.},
